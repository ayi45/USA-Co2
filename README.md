# USA-Co2 Percentage - Public Data Repository
This repository contains the percentage increase of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States from years 1800 to 2022.

## Origin
The base data comes from https://ourworldindata.org/energy Our World in Data. The base data contains data on all nations and all emissions regarding co2. 

Variables in the original data include:
* country
* year
* population
* iso_code
* gdp
* cement_co2
* cement_co2_per_capita
* co2
* co2_growth_abs
* co2_growth_prct
* share_global_other_co2
* share_of_temperature_change_from_ghg
* temperature_change_from_ch4
* temperature_change_from_co2
* temperature_change_from_ghg
* temperature_change_from_n2o
* total_ghg
* total_ghg_excluding_lucf
* trade_co2
* trade_co2_share

## Purpose
The trimmed data is intended to focus just on the increase in emission output by the United States. The only variable contained is "Percentage Increase" to give a clear frame of reference on the proportion of growth.

## Potential
Ideally this data can be used in climate research and examination. The data shows a clear upward trend and is able to smoothly visualize the exponential increase in co2 emissions by the US.
